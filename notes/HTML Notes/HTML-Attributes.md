# HTML Attributes

HTML attributes provide additional information about elements, defining their properties or behavior. They are included in the opening tag of an element and typically consist of a name and a value pair.

## Common Characteristics of Attributes

- **Name-Value Pairs**: Written as `name="value"`.
- **Placement**: Always appear in the opening tag.
- **Quotes**: Attribute values should be enclosed in double (`"`) or single (`'`) quotes.
